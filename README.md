- For [novices who use *Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (3rd Edition)*](https://github.com/FeignClaims/cpp_novice_template/tree/ppp3).
- For [novices who use *Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (2rd Edition)*](https://github.com/FeignClaims/cpp_novice_template/tree/ppp2).

## References

I learnt cmake mostly from [*Modern CMake for C++*](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Modern-CMake-for-Cpp).

What's more, this repository highly depends on [aminya/project_options](https://github.com/aminya/project_options), which improves the CMake experience a lot.

For conan 2.0, the [official documentation](https://docs.conan.io/2.0/index.html) is helpful.

Details about this repository can be found in [对配置文件的解释](https://vscode-cpp-starter.readthedocs.io/appendix/explain.html).
